# Forward Contract Valuation Simulator

This Streamlit application provides an interactive platform for users to understand and simulate the pricing and mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of forward contracts. It's designed for finance students, financial analysts, aspiring traders, and anyone interested in derivatives markets and quantitative finance.

## Application Overview
The "Forward Contract Valuation Simulator" demonstrates how initial forward prices are determined based on spot prices and risk-free rates, analyzes the evolution of a forward contract's MTM value over its life, and differentiates between contracts with and without additional costs or benefits. A key objective is to visualize potential gains and losses for both long and short positions under varying market conditions, thereby demystifying core derivative concepts like the no-arbitrage principle and mark-to-market adjustments through hands-on engagement.

## Features
- **Interactive Learning:** Dynamic, hands-on experience for complex financial concepts.
- **Clarity through Visualization:** Converts abstract financial formulas into intuitive, real-time charts using Plotly.
- **Practical Application:** Bridges theoretical knowledge with practical valuation scenarios.
- **Accessibility:** Easy-to-use interface without requiring advanced programming knowledge.
- **Real-time Updates:** All calculations and visualizations update instantaneously as input parameters are adjusted.

## How to Run

### Using Docker (Recommended)
1.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t forward-contract-simulator .
    ```
2.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 forward-contract-simulator
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

### Locally
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scriptsctivate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
5.  Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
