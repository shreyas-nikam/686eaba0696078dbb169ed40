# Forward Contract Valuation Simulator

## Overview
This Streamlit application provides an interactive platform for users to understand and simulate the pricing and mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of forward contracts. It demonstrates how initial forward prices are determined, analyzes the evolution of a forward contract's MTM value over its life, and differentiates between contracts with and without additional costs or benefits. The application visualizes potential gains and losses for both long and short positions under varying market conditions.

## Features
*   **Interactive Learning:** Dynamic, hands-on experience for complex financial concepts.
*   **Clarity through Visualization:** Converts abstract financial formulas into intuitive, real-time charts using Plotly.
*   **Practical Application:** Bridges theoretical knowledge with practical valuation scenarios.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface without requiring advanced programming knowledge.
