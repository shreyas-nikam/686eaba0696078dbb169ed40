# Technical Specification for Jupyter Notebook: Forward Contract Valuation Simulator

This document outlines the detailed specification for a Jupyter Notebook designed to simulate the pricing and mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of forward contracts. It will guide users through the theoretical foundations, practical implementation using Python, and visualization of contract dynamics.

## 1. Notebook Overview

This Jupyter Notebook serves as an interactive simulator for understanding the mechanics of forward contracts. It allows users to explore how various financial parameters influence the initial pricing and the subsequent mark-to-market valuation of these derivative instruments, both with and without additional costs or benefits.

### Learning Goals

Upon completing this notebook, users will:
*   Understand the no-arbitrage principle as it applies to forward contract pricing.
*   Learn how initial forward prices ($F_0(T)$) are determined based on spot prices ($S_0$), risk-free rates ($r$), and time to maturity ($T$).
*   Analyze the evolution of a forward contract's Mark-to-Market (MTM) value ($V_t(T)$) over its life due to changes in spot price ($S_t$), time ($t$), and other factors.
*   Differentiate between forward contracts that involve additional costs (e.g., storage costs) or benefits (e.g., dividends).
*   Visualize potential gains and losses for both long and short forward positions.
*   Understand the key insights contained in the provided CFA Derivatives Reading document and supporting data.

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of this lab, users will be able to:
*   Accurately calculate initial forward prices and MTM values for various scenarios.
*   Generate and interpret plots showing the time evolution and sensitivity of forward contract values.
*   Gain a hands-on, practical understanding of forward contract valuation concepts and their real-world implications.
*   Adjust key parameters to observe immediate impacts on contract valuation, facilitating scenario analysis.

## 2. Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations

This section will provide the necessary theoretical background and formulas, explained clearly using LaTeX.

### 2.1 Introduction to Forward Contracts and No-Arbitrage

A forward contract is a customized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified price on a future date. At inception ($t=0$), a forward contract typically has a value of zero, reflecting the no-arbitrage principle [1], [2]. This principle dictates that in an efficient market, there should be no opportunity to make risk-free profit. The pricing of forward contracts is designed to prevent such opportunities.

### 2.2 Key Variables

The following variables will be used throughout the notebook for calculations and explanations:
*   $S_0$: Spot price of the underlying asset at inception ($t=0$).
*   $S_t$: Spot price of the underlying asset at current time $t$.
*   $r$: Annualized risk-free rate (assumed constant, discretely compounded).
*   $T$: Time to maturity of the forward contract, in years.
*   $t$: Current time, in years, where $0 \le t \le T$.
*   $F_0(T)$: Forward price agreed upon at inception ($t=0$) for delivery at maturity $T$.
*   $V_t(T)$: Mark-to-Market (MTM) value of the forward contract at current time $t$.
*   $PV_t(I)$: Present value of any income or benefits (e.g., dividends) expected from the underlying asset between current time $t$ and maturity $T$, discounted to time $t$.
*   $PV_t(C)$: Present value of any costs (e.g., storage costs) expected from the underlying asset between current time $t$ and maturity $T$, discounted to time $t$.

### 2.3 Forward Price at Inception ($F_0(T)$)

The initial forward price is determined such that there is no immediate arbitrage opportunity.

#### Case 1: Underlying Asset with No Costs or Benefits
For an underlying asset that does not generate any income or incur any costs during the life of the contract, the initial forward price $F_0(T)$ is simply the future value of the spot price, compounded at the risk-free rate. This relationship is crucial for preventing arbitrage [4].

$$F_0(T) = S_0(1+r)^T$$

#### Case 2: Underlying Asset with Additional Costs or Benefits
When the underlying asset is expected to provide income (e.g., dividends for a stock) or incur costs (e.g., storage costs for a commodity) between inception and maturity, these cash flows must be factored into the forward price. The present value of these costs or benefits at inception ($PV_0(C)$ and $PV_0(I)$) modifies the effective initial investment in the underlying asset [6].

$$F_0(T) = (S_0 - PV_0(I) + PV_0(C))(1+r)^T$$

### 2.4 Mark-to-Market (MTM) Valuation ($V_t(T)$)

The MTM value of a forward contract changes over its life as market parameters (especially the spot price) evolve and as time passes [3]. The MTM value represents the gain or loss if the contract were to be settled immediately at time $t$.

#### Case 1: Long Forward Position with No Costs or Benefits
For a long forward position on an underlying asset without any associated costs or benefits, its value at time $t$ before maturity is the difference between the current spot price ($S_t$) and the present value of the *original* forward price ($F_0(T)$) discounted back from maturity $T$ to current time $t$ [5].

$$V_t(T) = S_t - F_0(T)(1+r)^{-(T-t)}$$

Here, $F_0(T)(1+r)^{-(T-t)}$ represents the present value of the original forward price at time $t$.

#### Case 2: Long Forward Position with Additional Costs or Benefits
If the underlying asset incurs costs or provides benefits during the contract's life, these must be accounted for in the MTM valuation. The MTM value at time $t$ is adjusted by the present value of any *remaining* costs or benefits from time $t$ to maturity $T$, discounted to time $t$ [7].

$$V_t(T) = (S_t - PV_t(I) + PV_t(C)) - F_0(T)(1+r)^{-(T-t)}$$

For a **short forward position**, the MTM value is simply the negative of the long position's MTM value:
$$V_t(T)_{\text{short}} = -V_t(T)_{\text{long}}$$

At maturity ($t=T$), the MTM value simplifies to the difference between the spot price at maturity ($S_T$) and the initial forward price ($F_0(T)$) for a long position, and vice-versa for a short position:
$$V_T(T)_{\text{long}} = S_T - F_0(T)$$
$$V_T(T)_{\text{short}} = F_0(T) - S_T$$

### 2.5 Real-World Applications

Understanding these valuations is crucial for participants in financial markets. Forwards are used for hedging against future price movements, speculation on asset prices, and arbitraging mispricings if they occur. The mark-to-market valuation allows investors and financial intermediaries to assess their current exposure and potential gains or losses.

### 3.7 Core Visuals - Aggregated Comparison: Profit/Loss at Maturity

**Markdown Cell:**
"This bar chart illustrates the profit or loss (P/L) of the forward contract at maturity ($t=T$) for different settlement spot prices ($S_T$) relative to the initial forward price ($F_0(T)$). This plot clearly shows the symmetric payoff profile of a forward contract."

**Code Cell:**
```python
# Define parameters for the P/L at maturity plot
S0_maturity = 100.0
r_maturity = 0.05
T_maturity_plot = 1.0 # The time horizon is maturity
PV0_I_maturity = 0.0 # Assuming no initial PV of cash flows for base F0(T)
PV0_C_maturity = 0.0 # Assuming no initial PV of cash flows for base F0(T)

# Calculate the initial forward price
F0_T_maturity = calculate_forward_price_initial(S0_maturity, r_maturity, T_maturity_plot, PV0_I_maturity, PV0_C_maturity)

# Define settlement spot prices (S_T) relative to F0_T
st_settlement_scenarios = {
    f'S_T < F0(T) - ${F0_T_maturity - 15:.2f}': F0_T_maturity - 15,
    f'S_T = F0(T) - ${F0_T_maturity:.2f}': F0_T_maturity,
    f'S_T > F0(T) - ${F0_T_maturity + 15:.2f}': F0_T_maturity + 15
}

pl_data = []
for label, St_val in st_settlement_scenarios.items():
    # P/L for long position at maturity is S_T - F_0(T)
    pl_long = St_val - F0_T_maturity
    # P/L for short position at maturity is F_0(T) - S_T
    pl_short = F0_T_maturity - St_val
    
    pl_data.append({'Settlement_Spot_Label': label, 'Settlement_Spot': St_val, 'Position': 'Long', 'P/L': pl_long})
    pl_data.append({'Settlement_Spot_Label': label, 'Settlement_Spot': St_val, 'Position': 'Short', 'P/L': pl_short})

pl_df = pd.DataFrame(pl_data)

# Plotting the Aggregated Comparison (Bar Chart)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(data=pl_df, x='Settlement_Spot_Label', y='P/L', hue='Position', palette='coolwarm')

plt.axhline(0, color='gray', linestyle='--', lw=0.8) # Line at zero P/L
plt.title(f'Profit/Loss at Maturity for Different Settlement Spot Prices (Initial F0(T) = ${F0_T_maturity:.2f})')
plt.xlabel('Settlement Spot Price ($S_T$) Scenario')
plt.ylabel('Profit / Loss ($)')

### 3.8 Data Validation and Summary Statistics (Synthetic Data)

**Markdown Cell:**
"Since we are generating synthetic data within the notebook, validation primarily involves ensuring inputs are within reasonable ranges and generated values adhere to expected properties (e.g., positive prices). We will also log basic summary statistics for any generated numerical data."

**Code Cell:**
```python
# Example: Validate input parameters for calculation functions
def validate_parameters(S0, r, T, t, St):
    if not all(isinstance(arg, (int, float)) and arg > 0 for arg in [S0, T, St]):
        raise ValueError("Spot price (S0, St) and Time to Maturity (T) must be positive numbers.")
    if not isinstance(r, (int, float)):
        raise ValueError("Risk-free rate (r) must be a number.")
    if not (0 <= t <= T):
        raise ValueError("Current time (t) must be between 0 and Time to Maturity (T).")
    print("Parameters validated successfully.")

# Example of logging summary statistics for generated spot price paths
print("\n--- Summary Statistics for Generated Spot Price Paths ---")
print(spot_paths_df.drop(columns='time').describe())

print("\n--- Summary Statistics for MTM Sensitivity Data ---")
print(mtm_sensitivity_df.describe())

print("\n--- Summary Statistics for P/L at Maturity Data ---")
print(pl_df.describe())
```

## 4. Additional Notes or Instructions

### 4.1 Assumptions and Constraints

*   **Compounding**: All calculations primarily use discrete compounding as per the provided formulas. Users interested in continuous compounding would need to modify the formulas accordingly (e.g., replace $(1+r)^t$ with $e^{rt}$).
*   **Risk-Free Rate**: The risk-free rate ($r$) is assumed to be constant over the entire life of the contract and for all discounting purposes.
*   **Cash Flows**: For costs ($PV_t(C)$) and benefits ($PV_t(I)$), the current implementation assumes these are given as a single present value at the time of valuation. More complex scenarios (e.g., multiple dividends, continuous storage costs) would require extending the `generate_pv_cashflow` function or incorporating specific cash flow schedules.
*   **Computational Performance**: The notebook is designed to execute quickly (< 5 minutes) and on a mid-spec laptop (8 GB RAM) by avoiding intensive simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo for price paths) and focusing on direct formula application and simple scenario generation.
*   **Libraries**: Only open-source Python libraries from PyPI are used.

### 4.2 Customization and Extension

Users can customize and extend this notebook in several ways:
*   **Alternative Spot Price Paths**: Implement more sophisticated spot price generation models (e.g., Geometric Brownian Motion) to simulate a wider range of market conditions for the Trend Plot.
*   **Cash Flow Structures**: Model specific dividend payment dates or continuous carrying costs (e.g., for commodities) rather than just a total present value.
*   **Impact of Volatility**: While not directly included in core forward pricing, volatility influences option pricing and can be a factor in forward *pricing discovery* in real markets. Users could explore this qualitatively.
*   **Interest Rate Term Structure**: Incorporate a non-flat yield curve, where the risk-free rate varies with maturity, to reflect more realistic market conditions.
*   **FX Forwards**: Extend the framework to include foreign exchange forward contracts, which involve two different risk-free rates (Equation 9 from the provided document).
*   **Sensitivity Analysis**: Add more interactive elements or plots to analyze the sensitivity of MTM values to changes in risk-free rate or time to maturity.
